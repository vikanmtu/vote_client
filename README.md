Client APP for secure voting

Secure e-Voting Client

The voting Client provides a secret vote and communicates with the server through the Tor network. Voting stages:
- scanning QR-code of a personal invitation to the elections;
- anonimous request the public key from onion-address specified server (end-to-end protected by Tor);
- personal authentication and registration;
- get anonymous ballot;
- voting (selection of a candidate and sending a closed ballot back to server);
- receiving a ticket (signature of closed voice) from the server and disclosing a voice;

Scaning of QR-code can switch Front/Back camera, set resolution and light. 
Alternatively instead of scan QR code you can use a binary file provided to the user as an invitation or enter the necessary data 

manually:
- onion-address of the server;
- number of the client in the voter list:
- his password;

Personal identification and registration implies identity disclosure  so after this stages you must exit from app and continue anonymous 
voting later. In this case, the Tor will be restarted and change your network identity and the time difference will prevent a possible 
attack on the disclosure of identity by the connection time.

All network transactions with the server have signatures and are saved on the local device: in the 'pub' subfolder in the application 
working folder in Windows and in the Android folder 'Documens' -> 'vote'. With these tickets you can prove the fact of fraud by the 
Registrar or the Recorder during the voting.
